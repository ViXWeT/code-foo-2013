#IGN Code Foo 2013 submission

######Update 2015:

This repository contains my submission for an IGN competition for a summer internship. All the files, including the descriptions are original, from the year 2013.


######Original descripton:

IMPORTANT NOTES:
I would like to note that my solutions contain mostly RAW algorithms. 
Which means the objective was completed and the programs are fitted with a sample test case.
However there is no direct console input implemented, additional test cases can be added through the main function.
Also there is usually no input validation. Errorless input was assumed for most cases.
Also when text file input was required. The input was programmed statically (the dimensions) which means its not flexible.

That being said, any input method, input validation or extra flexibility could have been easily programmed in if there was need for it.

Every program has a documentation.txt file that explains how the program works, the complexity(time/memory) of the algorithm and any additional useful notes.

Thank you for reading.
